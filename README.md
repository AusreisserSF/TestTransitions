This project is a general testbed for JavaFX.

The Main class and all of the test classes are in the sample package. Classes in the sample.auto class - currently only RobotConstants.java - and in sample.auto.fx are duplicates of classes in the project IJAprilTagNavigationSimulator. The code in those classes takes precedence.
